We are more like a community where all family members and friends are invited. 

The excersizes we do are focused on building the body capable of doing real life activities in a real live positoins. We don't insulate single musle or musclel groups, We treat it as a whole biomechanical mashine. It is not only lifting weights and pumping out in an idealised posture, created by expensive mashines.
